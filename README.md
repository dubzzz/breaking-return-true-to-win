# Breaking down *return true to win* using properties

## Abstract

The idea of *return true to win* exercises is to find a value such as a given function returns `true`.
Values can be of any types but can also be restricted to objects, arrays, functions depending on the problem statement. 

This repository applies property based testing, using framework [fast-check](https://github.com/dubzzz/fast-check), to solve such problems.

Statements have been extracted from https://alf.nu/ReturnTrue
